## Installing a Theme in Chrome

Google Chrome allows you to load extensions and themes that are stored in a folder on your computer. This is known as loading an "unpacked" extension.

1. Access the Extensions Page

- Open your Google Chrome browser.
- In the address bar, type chrome://extensions/ and press Enter.
- Alternatively, click the three vertical dots in the top-right corner, select Extensions, and then click Manage Extensions.

2. Enable Developer Mode
- In the top-right corner of the Extensions page, locate the toggle switch for Developer mode.
- Ensure the toggle is switched to the On position.

3. Load the Unpacked Theme
- Once Developer mode is enabled, a new bar will appear with three buttons. Click Load unpacked.
- A file browser window will open. Navigate to the folder where you have stored your generated theme files (this should be the folder containing the manifest.json file).
- Select the folder and click Open or Select Folder.
- Chrome will immediately apply the theme to your browser.
- If there are no errors in your manifest file, you will see the new theme reflected in your browser tabs and toolbar.
